A collection of solved exercises on linear systems analysis. The exercises focus on signal processing techniques and dynamic systems prediction, including:

1. **Signal analysis using FFT**  
   The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to analyze a noisy signal. The `elefante-ruidoso` file contains the data used.

2. **Signal filtering in electrocardiograms (ECG)**  
   An ECG signal is analyzed to study the cardiac cycle and apply filters to extract relevant information from the signal.

3. **Prediction of a chaotic time series**  
   A model is trained to predict a chaotic time series generated from the Mackey-Glass equation.
