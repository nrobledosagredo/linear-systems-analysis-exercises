## Overview

A collection of solved exercises on linear systems analysis. 

The exercises focus on signal processing techniques and dynamic systems prediction:

1. **Signal analysis using FFT**: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to analyze a noisy signal. The `elefante-ruidoso` file contains the data used.
2. **Signal filtering in electrocardiograms (ECG)**: An ECG signal is analyzed to study the cardiac cycle and apply filters to extract relevant information from the signal.
3. **Prediction of a chaotic time series**: A model is trained to predict a chaotic time series generated from the Mackey-Glass equation.
